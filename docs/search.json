    "title": "Clear lines, clear signal",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This post is based on the chapter “clean lines, clear signal” in the textbook by Dona Wong: “The Wall Street Journal Guide to Information Graphics: The Dos and Don’ts of Presenting Data, Facts, and Figures” (Wong 2010).\nOften we are faced with the problem of presenting comparisons of longitudinal data over many groups (e.g., multiple treatment arms, subgroup categories or individual patient time courses). It is tempting to differentiate each line by fully utilising the array of dashes and shape markers that are available within our favorite software package.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of six treatments measured by an outcome variable over time. A variation of symbols and line types are used to differentiate between treatments.\n\n\n\n\nBut this often obscures the lines which carry the information thereby reducing clarity.\n\nWeniger aber besser (Less but better) - Dieter Rams.\n\nThere are alternative strategies to address this problem depending on the purpose of your graph. For example, if it is possible to limit the number of comparison groups to four or less per graph then solid lines can be used exclusively. Varying weights and shades do the work of differentiating the lines removing the need for symbols and different line styles.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same example displaying only the first four treatments. Lines are differentiated by line colour. A solid line type is used to ensure the ‘trend’ is clearly displayed by treatment. Often by using a dashed or dotted line, visual artefacts are introduced.\n\n\n\n\nDirect labeling of each line can further support differentiation between groups when it is possible to apply without clashes (to the label positioning).\n\n\n\n\n\nRepeating the previous example but removing the legend. Labels are directly placed next to the line, removing the need for the reviewer to glance to and from the legend to the data display.\n\n\n\n\nBy using direct labelling we can go a step further and remove colour for differentiating between treatments without a lose in information.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of by simplifying (i.e. removing colour), we do not remove information, and in some cases we may increase clarity.\n\n\n\n\nThe advantage of removing colour is that we can also add it back in to serve another purpose. In the next example, we introduce colour to highlight a specific treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing colour to emphasise a specific treatment.\n\n\n\n\nIf it is not possible to limit the number of comparisons to four or less groups, consider using a panel of graphs (i.e. small multiple graphs on the same scale (Cleveland 1985; Tufte 1986)). This strategy allows all information to be presented on one graph, focusing each comparison of interest to a single panel.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of using small multiples (aka a trellis plot). The full data is displayed in a transparent colour and is pushed in to the background. For each panel, one treatment is highlighted and placed in to focus (using a stronger colour). This allows for comparisons by treatment, while introducing less clutter in to the visualisation.\n\n\n\n\nThe final example using small multiples allows the complete data to be displayed as well as facilitating comparisons between one treatment versus the others.\nIf any of this is useful, below is the code written in R for reproducing these plots used in this post along with the session information.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n## Set global theme\ntheme_set(theme_light())\n\n## Set seed for reproducibility \nset.seed(65)\n\n## Generate dummy data\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  Treatment = rep(c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\"),\n                  each = 4),\n  Treatment2 = rep(c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\"),\n                  each = 4),\n  Visit = rep(c(1, 2, 3, 4), 6),\n  Outcome = c(\n    rnorm(4, 2, 0.5),\n    rnorm(4, 3, 0.5),\n    rnorm(4, 2, 1),\n    rnorm(4, 3, 0.5),\n    rnorm(4, 2.5, 1),\n    rnorm(4, 3, 0.2)\n  )\n)\n\n## Plot all six lines\ndf %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = Visit, y = Outcome, group = Treatment, color = Treatment)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.1, aes(linetype = Treatment)) +\n  geom_point(size = 2.5, aes(shape = Treatment)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1, 4), breaks = c(1, 2, 3, 4)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 5), breaks = c(0, 2.5, 5)) \n\n## Plot only four lines\ndf %&gt;% \n  filter(Treatment %in% c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\")) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Visit, y = Outcome, group = Treatment, color = Treatment)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.2) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1, 4), breaks = c(1, 2, 3, 4)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 5), breaks = c(0, 2.5, 5)) \n\n## Direct labels on plot\ndf %&gt;% \n  filter(Treatment %in% c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\")) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Visit, y = Outcome, group = Treatment, color = Treatment)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.2) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1, 4), breaks = c(1, 2, 3, 4)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 5), breaks = c(0, 2.5, 5)) +\n  geom_text(\n    data = subset(df, Visit == \"4\" & (Treatment %in% c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\"))),\n    aes(label = Treatment),\n    position = \"nudge\",\n    hjust = -0.5,\n    vjust = 0.5,\n    color = \"black\"\n  ) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n## direct labels without colour \ndf %&gt;% \n  filter(Treatment %in% c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\")) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Visit, y = Outcome, group = Treatment)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.2, colour = \"#000000\", alpha = 0.8) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1, 4), breaks = c(1, 2, 3, 4)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 5), breaks = c(0, 2.5, 5)) +\n  geom_text(\n    data = subset(df, Visit == \"4\" & (Treatment %in% c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\"))),\n    aes(label = Treatment),\n    position = \"nudge\",\n    hjust = -0.5,\n    vjust = 0.5,\n    color = \"black\"\n  ) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n## direct labels highlighting a specific treatment\ndf %&gt;% \n  filter(Treatment %in% c(\"A\", \"B\", \"D\")) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Visit, y = Outcome, group = Treatment)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.0, colour = \"#000000\", alpha = 0.45) +\n    geom_line(\n    data = transform(df %&gt;% filter(Treatment == \"C\")),\n    aes(x = Visit, y = Outcome, group = Treatment2),\n    size = 1.2,\n    color = \"red\",\n    alpha = 0.8\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1, 4), breaks = c(1, 2, 3, 4)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 5), breaks = c(0, 2.5, 5)) +\n  geom_text(\n    data = subset(df %&gt;% filter(Visit == \"4\", Treatment %in% c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\"))),\n    aes(label = Treatment),\n    position = \"nudge\",\n    hjust = -0.5,\n    vjust = 0.5,\n    color = \"black\"\n  ) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n## Small multiples plot\ndf %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = Visit, y = Outcome, group = Treatment)) +\n  geom_line(\n    data = transform(df, Treatment = NULL),\n    aes(x = Visit, y = Outcome, group = Treatment2),\n    size = 0.8,\n    color = \"#000000\",\n    alpha = 0.25\n  ) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.2, color = \"red\", alpha = 0.9) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1, 4), breaks = c(1, 2, 3, 4)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 5), breaks = c(0, 2.5, 5)) +\n  facet_wrap( ~ Treatment) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nCleveland, William S. 1985.

To facilitate effective comparisons there are a number of design options in the toolbox which can be used including layering, alignment, proximity and ordering.\nFollowing on from the previous post, we now focus on how the alignment of a comparison is an important consideration.\n\nHorizontal vs. vertical alignment\nAlignment is another consideration for facilitating comparisons. Where appropriate, using a vertical comparison can help make judgments easier than the same comparisons horizontally aligned. To illustrate, consider three point estimates and associated uncertainty intervals.\nFirst we set up R and generate the data.\nWe now plot the three intervals side by sided, aligned horizontally and vertically.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of the same plot displayed differently by rotating the axes in turn changing how the the comparisons are aligned. The left plot the comparison is made scanning left to right (and back). The right plot the comparison is made by scanning top to bottom.\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that its “easier” to make comparisons scanning up and down than going from left to right. This is of course subjective but combined with potentially sorting comparisons by the point estimate can help guide judgments (Cleveland 1985).\nNow back to the “when appropriate” caveat. If the comparison(s) are made on data that is sequential (i.e. a comparison of longitudinal effects), doing so may confuse the reviewer; time is often encoded better by flowing left to right.\nA final rationale for selecting a vertical alignment of comparisons is that is can help with adding in contextual information such as longer informative labels.\n\n\n\n\n\nRepeating the same plot with the addition of axis labels. Aligning the comparisons to be vertical allows for longer labels to be displayed with relative ease.\n\n\n\n\nOn the left-hand side the labels blend in together. Typically this requires shortening the label length through abbreviation or by other means such as changing the angle the text direction. By switching the alignment of the comparison (i.e. flipping the coordinates), the longer labels are easier to display without modification that may impact readability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nCleveland, William S. 1985.

It is one that enables visual comparisons of data within the reviewers eye span, and adapts to the audience in a manner that best allows the key messages to be understood.\nDuring the design of data visualisation it is helpful to keep in mind the purpose – the “Compared to what?” (Tufte 1990).\nTo facilitate effective comparisons there are a number of design options in the toolbox which can be used including layering, alignment, proximity and ordering. In this post we focus on how to focus and support specific comparisons through the use of a visual hierarchy.\n\nAdding context through visual hierarchy\nUtilising and layering visual anchors such as grid and reference lines, annotations and other cues can draw attention to the comparison of interest. To illustrate what we mean by anchors, consider the graph below: a stripped down scatter plot.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an example of a bare-bones scatter plot.\n\n\n\n\nThere is not a lot of information carried in this plot. If you are quantitively trained you may automatically be comparing the relationship between the x- and y-variables, assessing if there is a (linear or non-linear) relationship by eye. You may also be on the look out for unusual observations. But without the appropriate level of contextual information we have to make various assumptions that may not hold (e.g. what scale are the observations plotted on.)\nNow lets consider adding back in contextual information step by step. We can start to layer on visual anchors to meet specific goals. For example, by adding grid lines and axes we can help the reviewer identify the x- and y-values for specific observations.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding in axes and grid lines. Now it is possible to read off the values of each observation. We also know that the data is plotted on a linear scale for both axes.\n\n\n\n\nAdding a reference line can further help distinguish between observations and also draw comparisons to the reference i.e. if an observation or how many observations are above and below the line of interesting. Adding a reference line can also facilitate assessments that compare the distance between the reference line and observation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding a reference line.\n\n\n\n\nWe can also fit and display a regression to help the reviewer assess the association between the x- and y- variables. In this example, we fit a spline along with a measure of uncertainty to help assess the spline fit with respect to the data sample.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding a spline and uncertainty interval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can add additional visual anchors to the plot to help guide the comparisons.\n\n\n\n\nFinally we can add additional annotations such as a description of the reference line and highlighting a specific observation that may hold a degree of importance to the analysis. We also add labels for the x and y- variables providing additional context for the revieiwer.\nThe final example illustrates how layering visual anchors on to a plot can guide the focus of the reviewer to specific comparisons of interest such as the association between the outcome and a covairate of interest, the strength of the association (model fit) and also highlight specific observations of interest).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nTufte, Edward R. 1990.

He is also an active teacher on the principles of data visualization and now author of a new book on the subject of graphical principles written fully in R Bookdown. His book is an excellent and clear guide for developing effective graphs, starting from the basic principles through to many hands on examples. The book also acts a quick start how to guide for R and ggplot2.\nAlthough the book is aimed at the social sciences the content of the book and the underlying principles apply to all quantitative disciplines. For example, there is a section dedicated to the presentation of estimates and predictions from a statistical model, covering extensions to ggplot such as GGally.\nAn online version of the book is now available at http://socviz.co/."

    "text": "Why? (Sinek 2009; Bonate 2014) What is the purpose of this display or that communication? Doumont (Jean L. Doumont 2002) states this as the “zeroth law” of professional communication, “a principle so obvious that it had long been overlooked”. Be clear and explicit about what you want to achieve. Is it to explore some data, to convey an inferential analysis, to deliver a message, convince an audience, or support a decision? It may be a mixture of these – for example, even seemingly simple exploratory plots should serve some (perhaps implicit) decision (e.g. on how to explore further). Every graph, and more generally every communication, must be tailored to its specific purpose.\nIt helps to carve out the scientific question you are trying to address, ideally in discussion with partners, and to write it down explicitly. Try not to look at any data before. This is the concept of “question-based visualizations”(Vandemeulebroecke et al. 2019): let the scientific question determine what data to display and how. (For example, combine data from different domains if it helps address the question effectively. Do not only produce standard outputs by data domain – a display should be determined by the question it addresses, not by the way the data is organized.). As Diggle (Diggle 2018) put it, we “analyze problems, not data”. This does not mean that the question could not be refined after seeing the data. We may well iterate over the problem space and the solution space – as long as we do it consciously. Senn (Senn 2008) illustrates many examples of wrongly framed research questions. A common one is to focus on the wrong comparison, such as comparing a post-treatment value to the corresponding baseline value instead of to the value under a control treatment. Most quantitative graphs display comparisons (Gelman, Pasarica, and Dodhia 2002), and it always helps to ask “compared to what?” (Tufte 1986). If the comparison is not clear to the author, it will also not be clear to the reader.\nPart of this first law (and of the third, see below) is also to be clear about your audience. Then, to adapt to your audience. Do not assume it will adapt to you. You cannot control your audience, but you can control what information and messages you deliver to it, and how. Is your audience just you (trying to see patterns in data), you in a few years (trying to remember what you did), quantitative experts such as your peers (interested in your methods), subject matter experts (eager for your main message), decision-makers (headlines only), or a mixture of these? Your visual communication will need to be different accordingly. Your communication (plot, presentation, report) is for the audience, not for you.\nClarity on the purpose and the scientific question of interest will help choose appropriate quantitative methods to address them. This, plus clarity on your audience, will help define the key messages and how to deliver them. (On the aspect of delivery see also Law 3 below.)\nOf note, this first law is so important that it may occasionally defy other good principles. If your primary goal is to catch attention, then you may choose an iconic graphical representation that does this well, even if it violates some of the recommendations given further below (Gelman and Unwin 2013). However, you should never distort the data."

    "title": "Three laws of visual communication",
    "section": "Law 2: Show the data clearly",
    "text": "Law 2: Show the data clearly\nThis is Tufte’s maxim (Tufte 1986): “Above all else, show the data”. Show it accurately and clearly. This law has several faces:\n\nSimplify! “Simplify to clarify” (B. Wong 2011). It is the prime task of quantitative scientists to make the complex simple: reveal structure in data through models, make inference through analyses, distill and convey conclusions through (visual) communication. Choose the simplest appropriate graph type; prefer familiar designs over fancy ones (see also the Cleveland-McGill effectiveness ranking in Law 3 below). Avoid fake dimensions. Make your plot “as simple as it can be, but not simpler” (attributed to Albert Einstein; also “Occam’s razor” or the law of parsimony). “Understand, edit and simplify the information and design with your readers in mind” (D. M. Wong 2010). Do not be confused: it is hard to make things simple. This is an iterative process: “edit and revise” (Tufte 1986), and repeat.\nMaximize the data-to-ink ratio (also “data density index” (Tufte 1986)) within reason. Maximize the signal over the noise by removing the noise: remove anything that distracts from the purpose of the graph. Nothing is neutral: the choice of symbols or colors, background, fonts, line style, annotations. These elements are noise if they do not serve a clear purpose. Choose them wisely and parsimoniously; make the data stand out. Do not trust defaults in graphical software packages. Often, intelligent use of white space can structure a display better than a lot of ink. (The same holds for tables: these are often most effectively structured by reserving black lines for the horizontal direction and using simple alignment in the vertical direction.) Never clutter your graph with “chart junk” (Tufte 1997).\nDisplay the relevant data directly. In a quantitative workflow, this often means to look at the raw data and not just rely on summary statistics. Cabanski8 illustrates this with nine datasets that show completely different patterns despite identical marginal means, standard deviations and correlation coefficients (see also Anscombe (Anscombe 1973) and Matejka and Fitzmaurice (Matejka and Fitzmaurice 2017)). Ask yourself what is the best way of summarizing the relevant features of the data; it may not be the mean +/- standard error. When fitting a (statistical, compartmental, mechanistic etc.) model to the data to draw inference or make predictions, model-derived quantities may be the relevant data to display. In this case a plot of the raw data may be misleading if it does not account for important covariates. In a final communication, display concisely what best supports your message (see also below, Law 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 illustrates some aspects of this second law. Wainer (Wainer 1984) has turned this law around, noting that “methods for displaying data badly have been developed for many years, and a wide variety of interesting and inventive schemes have emerged”. He provides 12 highly amusing rules for “how to display data badly”, with striking examples. He then concludes more seriously: “The rules for good display are quite simple. Examine the data carefully enough to know what they have to say, and then let them say it with a minimum of adornment. Do this while following reasonable regularity practices in the depiction of scale, and label clearly and fully."

    "section": "Law 3: Make the message obvious",
    "text": "Law 3: Make the message obvious\nIf the second law focused on the data (with a tendency to reduce noise), then the third is all about the message (and amplifying the signal). This assumes that you do have a message to tell, and that this message is clear at least to yourself. If there is any doubt on this, return to the first law.\nThe third law mandates to make your message as obvious as possible. Quoting Krzywinski and Cairo (Krzywinski and Cairo 2013), “inviting readers to draw their own conclusions is risky”. Do not only make your message easy to get. Make it impossible to miss. This extends beyond graphical elements and involves all aspects of communication.\nClarity on your audience, mentioned already in the first law, is also a prerequisite for the third. It is needed for carving out the message to tell (Law 1) and for adapting its way of delivery (Law 3).\nSpecific examples for the third law include the following:\n\nChoose wisely how to encode the data you display. Color and area are good for drawing attention, but a viewer can decode positions on a common scale much more easily and accurately. Consider the effectiveness ranking of graphical attributes for encoding numerical values, as proposed by Cleveland and McGill [Cleveland (1985); Cleveland (1984); Cleveland.McGill1984; Cleveland1987; Cleveland and McGill (1985)] (see also Cairo (Cairo 2016), Munzner (Munzner 2015), and Heer and Bostock (Heer and Bostock 2010)). See here for an overview of this ranking.\nExploit pre-attentive processing as much as possible (Few 2012; Ware 2004). Some graphical features “jump to the eye” while others require careful inspection. Consider this in your choice of how to encode the data (Cleveland-McGill effectiveness ranking, see above) and in your choice of symbols, colors, line types etc. See here for an illustration.\nAvoid mental arithmetic. If differences or ratios are the main interest, show them directly. If both raw values and differences are of interest, consider showing both.\nExploit the principles of visual grouping (B. Wong 2010). Graphical entities are most effectively grouped by enclosure, connection, proximity and similarity (in this order). That is, similar objects are perceived as belonging together, as are objects close to each other, connected by lines, or enclosed in a common subspace. See Figure 3 for an illustration: these mechanisms can provide contextual information to a plot in a simple yet powerful way.\nMinimize the viewer’s eye movement. Place elements that are to be compared close to each other. Prefer direct labelling over a legend. See also here.\nDraw the reader’s attention to the main points. Use appropriate graphical features (e.g. bold or colored highlighting, reference lines, circling etc.). Follow up with explicit labelling (e.g. “treatment A outperforms treatment B by X%”).\nAdd meaningful information to a graph to tell the whole story. E.g., include reference lines, benchmark effects, inferences etc.\nUse effective redundancy. Convey the same message through multiple channels, to amplify it and give the audience a second chance to get it. Use words and pictures in unison (J. L. Doumont 2009). E.g., in addition to showing the data, consider annotating the “good” or “bad” axis direction, and state what is seen in plain words. Do not confuse redundancy (pointlessly cluttering the graph) with effective redundancy (conveying a message through multiple complementary channels).\nLet every plot stand on its own. Use informative labels and captions, and explain abbreviations. Do not require the reader to search through text in order to understand a figure.\nAlways add a title to your plot. Phrase it as a conclusion, not a description (e.g. “plasma concentration depends on body weight” rather than “plot of plasma concentration vs. body weight”)."
